# The Paint Mixer
 Welcome to the Paint Mixing Assistant project! This Java program assists you in solving a paint mixing puzzle by providing a command-line interface (CLI) game. You'll attempt to guess a paint mixture, and the program will guide you with feedback on your attempts. The project comprises several classes, including PaintMix, Attempt, PaintMixGame, and PaintAssistanceCli.
 The PaintMix class defines a paint mixture using an array of characters. The Attempt class represents a single attempt in the game, evaluating the correctness of the suggestion against the solution. The PaintMixGame class manages the game logic, generating a random solution and maintaining a log of previous attempts using a linked list structure. Lastly, the PaintAssistanceCli class contains the main method for the CLI interface.
